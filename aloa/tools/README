HLL

    HLL -- Heuristic Lint issue Locator.

    After a PC-Lint run, you frequently want to know what exactly a warning is
    about. In this case, you fire-up 'msg.txt' and search for the error number.

    With HLL its much easier: you just pass it the error number (or numbers)
    and it extracts the corresponding parts from ‘msg.txt’ and displays them on
    the console.

    You can find more info on HLL in the Perl script or by running HLL without any
    arguments. 


GCCLINT
    
    GCCLINT allows you to use PC-Lint via the Wine emulator with Linux/GCC. 

    In a first step, GCCLINT extracts GCC include path settings as well as
    preprocessor definitions and creates a corresponding .lnt file. In a second
    step, this .lnt file is passed (together with any user provided PC-Lint
    command-line options) to PC-Lint.
